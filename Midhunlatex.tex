\begin{abstract}{\normalfont\fontsize{14}{16}\bfseries}
\raggedright

Conveyor tracking using collaborative robots equipped with vision cameras represents a significant advancement in modern production. This innovative approach enables cobots to interact dynamically with moving goods on conveyor belts, thereby enhancing efficiency, precision, and adaptability. By utilizing vision cameras, cobots can accurately detect, locate, and track objects in real-time, accommodating changes in shape, speed, and orientation. The integration of vision technology allows cobots to perform tasks such as sorting, assembly, and pick-and-place operations with minimal human intervention. \\

This thesis explores the technical aspects of conveyor tracking with cobots, highlighting the role of vision systems in improving automation capabilities, reducing error rates, and enabling flexible manufacturing environments. It also addresses the challenges of synchronizing cobot actions with fast-moving conveyors and discusses the potential benefits for industries such as logistics, packaging, and electronics assembly. \\

The experimental work involves establishing a collaborative environment of cobots for conveyor tracking experiments using a vision camera. The primary objective is to enhance the tracking accuracy of objects and capture various shapes on the conveyor belt. The experimental setup includes two cobots, a conveyor belt, two grippers, and objects of different shapes. As the conveyor belt moves these objects, the vision camera captures their images and poses, along with their part coordinate system (PCS). This information is relayed to the first robot, which sorts the objects based on shape. The second robot then synchronizes with the sorted objects in a designated capture zone, picking them up and placing them into user-defined target boxes. Once filled, the boxes are removed via the conveyor or another transport mechanism.
