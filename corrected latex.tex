\begin{abstract}
{\normalfont\fontsize{14}{16}\selectfont
The infusion of artificial intelligence (AI) into robotics has been instrumental in automating industries, ushering in the era of the 4th Industrial Revolution. Despite the rapid advancements, the absence of specific standards guiding the operations of AI-driven robots poses inherent risks. This study examines EN ISO 10218-1,2:2011 and ISO/TS 15066, revealing a need for more explicit directives on operational dos and don'ts and system requirements for AI in robotics.

To address this gap, we employ Failure Mode Effect Analysis (FMEA) as a systematic tool to analyze failure modes in AI-integrated robotics. FMEA extended with STPA provides a comprehensive approach to identify hazards related to components and subsystems. Following EN IEC 60812:2018 guidelines, we assess severity, occurrence, and detectability of the failure modes, culminating in calculating Risk Priority Numbers (RPNs) for prioritizing risks and their subsequent mitigation.

While our primary focus was on perception-based grasping, our vision extends to broader applications, AI functionalities, and varied scenarios. This iterative process aims to provide a comprehensive safety framework for AI in robotics. The study contributes to the safer integration of AI in an ever-evolving technological landscape, providing a foundation for future advancements.
